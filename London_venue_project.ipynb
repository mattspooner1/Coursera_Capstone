    "London is one of the largest metropolises in the world where almost **9 million** people live and it has a population density of **5,701** people per square kilometer. As a resident of the city, I decided to use London in my project. The city is divided into 33 boroughs in total each controlled by a different political party which is often a good indicator for the affluence of the borough.\n",
    "\n",
    "While London isn't the largest city or the most densely populated, it is extremely expensive and hard for any new business to prosper. It's not unusual for a small independent business to crop up one month and close down the next due to high rent and high competition. I aim to deliver insights into areas that business owners and investors should set up to avoid running themselves out of business. \n",
    "\n",
    "We would expect that cheaper areas would be more sought after for new business owners and more expensive areas for those already with a large brand behind them.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we consider these things, we can create a map and information chart where the real estate index is placed on London and each district is clustered according to the venue density."
